What was the bathroom accuracy?;
Did you wash your hands?;
Did you put the wet floor sign up?;
You do realize we have cams in your bathroom, right?;
I hope you didn't try one of your 360 no scopes again!;
How the heck did you manage to hit the ceiling?;
R.I.P. bathroom floor, it never had a chance!;
How did you miss although sitting down?;
Just FYI, peeing your name doesn't work on tiles or carpets, only on surfaces like snow.;
